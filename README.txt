For Question 1:
Instructions to run the code:

1.Using Command Prompt:

First run the KV_Vrep_Demonstration_final_Q1.ttt VREP file. The run the following command in command prompt:
python ...PATH...\BehaviourRobot\Project3\Question1\Project3_Q1.py       // use python3 if using Linux based OS

2.Using PyCharm or any other IDE:

Open KV_Vrep_Demonstration_final_Q1.ttt VREP file and Project3_Q1 python file and 
Run the VREP file first and then the Python file.

3. Once both files are running and properly linked, press UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT Arrow Keys on the keyboard to control the robot movement.

Special Instructions:

-- Install all package dependencies like pynput before running the code.
-- Update pip and all the packages to the latest versions.
-- Make sure you have the following files in your directory:
	1. vrep.py
	2. vrepConst.py
	3. simpleTest.py (or any other example file) 
	4. The appropriate remote API library: "remoteApi.dll" (Windows)(64-bit/32-bit), "remoteApi.dylib" (Mac) or "remoteApi.so" (Linux)
	5. Go to this path directory to find the remoteApi.dll C:\Program Files\V-REP3\V-REP_PRO_EDU\programming\remoteApiBindings\lib\lib\
-- Change the port number from 19999 to 19997 or vice versa incase the connection to vrep fails.


For Question 2:
Instructions to run the code:

1.Using Command Prompt:

First run the KV_Vrep_Demonstration_final_Q2.ttt VREP file. The run the following command in command prompt:
python ...PATH...\BehaviourRobot\Project3\Question2\project3_q2.py       // use python3 if using Linux based OS

2.Using PyCharm or any other IDE:

Open KV_Vrep_Demonstration_final_Q2.ttt VREP file and project3_q2 python file and 
Run the VREP file first and then the Python file.

3. Once both files are running and properly linked, the robot will wander around on its own whilst avoiding any obstacles in its path.
